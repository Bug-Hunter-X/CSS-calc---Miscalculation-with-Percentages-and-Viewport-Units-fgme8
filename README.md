This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using the `calc()` function in CSS with a combination of percentages and viewport units (like `vw` or `vh`). The expected behavior is that the calculation should produce a specific value, however, the actual rendered result differs from the expected outcome.  The solution file provides a corrected approach for the calculation, ensuring accurate rendering.
